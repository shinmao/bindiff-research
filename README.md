# bindiff-research
The purpose of this repository is to collect and summarize some binary-diffing related literature reviews and the results of the observation on binary difference. It would be more close to patch analysis so that we would focus on comparing unpatched and patched binaries.

## Literature review
The format would be sorted in ascending order on published year or month. The content should include goal, assumption, contribution, future work, and the core idea (some techniques can be included but not all details) of the paper.
