# bindiff-research
The purpose of this repository is to collect and summarize some binary-diffing related literature reviews and the results of the observation on binary difference. It would be more close to patch analysis so that we would focus on comparing unpatched and patched binaries.

## Literature review
The format would be sorted in ascending order on published year or month. The content should include goal, assumption, contribution, future work, and the core idea (some techniques can be included but not all details) of the paper.

### SPAIN: Security Patch Analysis for Binaries Towards Understanding the Pain and Pills (ICSE 2017)
* Goal:  
* Assumtion:  
* Core idea:  
* Future work:  

### PatchScope: Memory Object Centric Patch Diffing (CCS 20)
* Goal: A new way of patch diffing to make insight of patch details and fixed vulnerabilities (memory corruption based).  
* Assumption: Given PoC  
* Core idea:
  * Compare **memory object access sequence(MOAS)** to understand the details of patch more concisely than difference at assembly-level  
* Future work:  

> By Rafael. Cool! But without source code to prove implementation.
